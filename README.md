# cat_dog_identifier
Analyze a picture and report wether it is a cat or dog

The data folders should contain a sub-folder titled PetImages which contains two sub-folders, one titled 'cat' and one titled 'dog'.

These folders should each contain any number of cat images and dog images specific to the folder their contained in.

The test I posted contains 255 images each for a total of 510 images but this can be modified however you wish.

Also note that there should be an unseen image of a dog or cat for the program to identify at the end. This image should be stored in the cat_dogs_starter root folder along with the other files and folders (networks, final_project_starter_cap4630.m, etc..)
